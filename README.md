# Linear Regression Model
***

In this project (jupyter notebook) we are using <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/">SickitLearn</a> models, to perform linear regression to make income predictions with the dataset made available in the repository.

Linear regression, is a supervised machine learning model which implements a linear relationship between an independent and 
dependent variable. It is a statistical method of making predictive analysis.  We can illustrate linear regression by the below formula:

<i>y= a<sub>0</sub>+a<sub>1</sub>x+ ε</i>

Where
<i>Y</i> represents  = The Dependent Variable (Target Variable)
X represents = The Independent Variable (Predictor Variable)
a0 represents = The intercept of the line (Gives an additional degree of freedom)
a1 represents = The Linear regression coefficient (Scale factor for each input value)
ε represents = The Random error

## Preparing Data For Linear Regression
